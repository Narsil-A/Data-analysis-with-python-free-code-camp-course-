# Data Science and Visualization Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science and data visualization projects, showcasing skills in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Projects

### Demographic Data Analyzer

This project analyzes a dataset extracted from the 1994 Census database. It uses Pandas for data manipulation and provides insights into various demographic factors like age, education, and income. 

#### Key Features:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization

### Medical Examination Data Visualization

This project involves the analysis and visualization of medical examination data. It uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the dataset containing various health metrics.

#### Key Features:

- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering (Adding 'Overweight' column)
- Data visualization using bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps

---

### Time Series Visualization

This project visualizes time series data, specifically the number of page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016 to 2019. It uses Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

#### Key Features:

- Data cleaning and filtering
- Time series line plot
- Bar chart for average daily page views per month
- Box plots to show data distribution

### Sea Level Predictor

This project aims to predict future sea levels by analyzing past data. It uses the `scipy.stats.linregress` function to calculate the line of best fit over sea level data since 1880.

#### Key Features:

- Scatter plot of sea levels over time
- Line of best fit to predict future sea levels
- Data analysis based on the year 2000 onwards
